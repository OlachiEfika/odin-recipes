# odin-recipes
# This is my first project, building a basic recipe website
# The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes
# This project will showcase the skills I have learnt in the foundational course of the Odin Project
# These include creating basic web pages with HTML & CSS, working with repositories using Git/Github
