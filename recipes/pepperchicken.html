    <strong><p> Cooking Directions</p></strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the marinated chicken in a pot and allow to steam in its own juices for about 10 minutes. Then add some water to cook till done.</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is done, separate the stock and fry/grill or broil in the oven at 180Â°C (350F) till golden brown. You can use the chicken stock to prepare another meal like Jollof rice. </li>
            <li>Heat up some vegetable oil in a dry pot.</li>
            <li>Add the roughly chopped pepper blend and start frying on low to medium heat till all the water dries up and the oil floats. </li>
            <li>Add the grilled/broiled chicken into the fried pepper mix, and add little quantities of same spices used to spice the chicken if necessary.</li> 
            <li>Stir until all the chicken is coated with the mix. Add in the thinly chopped onions to garnish and serve hot.</li>
       </ol>
